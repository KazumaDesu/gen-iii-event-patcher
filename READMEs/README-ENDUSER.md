# gen-iii-event-patcher for end users
This README is meant for those just looking to patch an event into a save file.

NOTE: This assumes you are playing on an emulator. If you wish to do this on real hardware, you will either need a method to backup and restore save data, or use a distribution ROM instead.

## Dependencies and Requirements
* Java version 8, obtainable [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
* Ability to use a terminal. The terminal is your friend.
* A compatible ROM, which currently includes:
  * Any non-Japanese FireRed
  * Any non-Japanese LeafGreen
  * Any non-Japanese Emerald

## Usage
